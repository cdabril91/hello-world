My first repository

This is my first github repository and I'm not totally sure what the direction of this first project will be, however I am interested in understanding how to work with github.

About Me:
I am 23, currently studying Computer Science at Pasadena City College and finishing up coursework with intent to transfer to University for my Bachelor's Degree.
